1) An overview of the function of the code (i.e., what it does and what it can be used for). 
	
	Overall, we wrote a react web application that will benefit members of the computer science department that are looking to    search through the cs.illinois page with advanced search functionalities (i.e what type of student, words to exclude, and what type of page they are searching for). Our code takes all the user input from the page the search terms, the worlds to exclude, etc and then makes an API call to Googleâ€™s server with those specific request and only ask for results with cs.illinois.edu. This API call is possible because on the backend with Google we set up a search engine with them and they provided us with a CX code and an API key to use. This code can be very useful for instance if your searching for all PDF documents on the CS page related to your search. Also if you looking for faculty pages or welcome pages mixed with your search query our engine will handle that also.  


2) Documentation of how the software is implemented with sufficient detail so that others can have a basic understanding of your code for future extension or any further improvement. 

	Added into the App.js file

3) Documentation of the usage of the software including either documentation of usages of APIs or detailed instructions on how to install and run a software, whichever is applicable.

  	Npm install
	
	Npm start 
	
	Open browser and go to localhost:3000
	
  	API Code is include included in code comments

	(50% of the work)Harpreet: Added all the advanced functionality buttons, restructured the code, added comments to the code 
	
	(50% of the work)Shivan: Set up google custom search, got api key, setup initial website with google api call, redesigned the UI
	
	Overall both of us evenly shared the work and got the project done that far exceeded our initial thoughts with a layout easy   for anyone to use.
